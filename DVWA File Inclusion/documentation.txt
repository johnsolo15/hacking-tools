This exploit uses a remote file inclusion vulnerability in the DVWA source
code to inject malicious code that will steal the /etc/passwd file and the
PHPSESSID cookie. The particular page that we are exploiting has code that
sets a variable called file to whatever the page variable is set to in the
URL. When we look in the source code for the page on the dvwa server we see
the code include($file);. This will include whatever the file variable is in
the source code of the web page. The file variable can be set in the URL by
specifying what code the page variable points to. We can then run whatever
code we want on the server by including it on the page. This exploit will
use a bait link to trick a user into redirecting to the dvwa file inclusion
page with the URL variable page set to our own malicious code. This malicious
code will then execute on the dvwa server, copy the /etc/passwd file, and the
PHPSESSID cookie. These to pieces of info will be sent via post to a recieving
code on our attacking server. This code will then write the two pieces of
information to files on the attacking computer.
