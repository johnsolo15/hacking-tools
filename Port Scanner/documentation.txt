NAME
    portscanner.sh

USAGE
    portscanner.sh [-t] [hostname startport stopport]

DESCRIPTION
    Scans the ports of a host and determines whether they
    are open or not. The output lists each port scanned and writes whether
    it is open or closed.

OPTIONS

    -t          set the timeout. Default is 2.

Interactive Mode
    Interactive mode can used by running portscanner without any options
    or arguments. You will be prompted to manually input the hostname
    startport and stopport.

    Interactive mode can also be ran by piping inputs from a file using
    cat. Eg. cat filename | portscanner.sh where filename is a file with
    a hostname followed by startport on a new line followed by stopport
    on a new line. The file can  have any number of host/port combinations.
